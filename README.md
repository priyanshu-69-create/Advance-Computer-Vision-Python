Gesture Volume Control

This project involves developing a system that controls the volume of my computer through hand gestures using Python. The system utilizes a camera to capture real-time hand movements and interpret them as commands to adjust the system’s audio level. By employing libraries such as OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for hand tracking, the project tracks the position and motion of the user's hands. Specific gestures, like moving the hand up or down, correspond to volume increases or decreases. Additionally, I incorporated Python’s PyAutoGUI library to interact with the operating system's volume controls. The goal of this project is to provide a hands-free, intuitive method of adjusting the computer's volume, offering convenience and accessibility for users.
